## General info
This project is a simple personal portfolio website which showcase my skills and experience. The structure of the website is built using HTML5, ensuring semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO. CSS is used to style and layout the content, making the website visually appealing and responsive on various devices. To add interactivity and dynamic elements, JavaScript is used. This includes smooth animations, interactive buttons, and form validation. To expedite development and ensure consistent styling, here we have used the Bootstrap framework. To handle dynamic content and server-side operations, I've integrated PHP into my portfolio website where I've implemented a contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly. PHP is used to process the form submissions and send emails to my designated email address.
